.SH NAME
foomatic-compiledb \- compile the foomatic driver database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI foomatic-compiledb \ [ \-f \ ]\ [ \-j \ n\ ]\ [\ driver\ ...\ \ ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foomatic-compiledb
generates all Foomatic data files for a given spooler (or Foomatic combo
XML files) and either all drivers/printers, or a selected range of drivers.
It generally should not be necessary except for people who want to generate
a set of Foomatic data files for distribution. For configuring single
printers foomatic-datafile and especially foomatic-configure
will automagically compute just what they need.

.SS Options
.TP 10

KDE 2.x).

.SH AUTHORS
Manfred Wassmann <\fImanolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de\fR> and Till Kamppeter
<\fItill.kamppeter@gmx.net\fR> for the foomatic
project using output from the associated binary.

.SH BUGS
Existing files are always conserved instead of older files being
overwritten. So deleting the destination directory (rm -rf dir) and
calling foomatic-compiledb without the -f option is recommended.

Please send bug reports to foomatic-devel@linuxprinting.org.
