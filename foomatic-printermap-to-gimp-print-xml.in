# This script updates the printer list of the driver XML file of
# GIMP-Print (db/source/driver/gimp-print.xml in foomatic-db package)
# according to the file src/foomatic/foomatic-printermap of the source
# tarball of GIMP-Print 4.2.x or later.
#
# Remarks:
#
# - Manually added printer entries will not be removed. They drop out
#   to the beginning of the printer list during the update. The same
#   happens to printers which are removed from the new foomatic-printermap
#
# - All printers of foomatic-printermap are put to the end of the list,
#   the order of foomatic-printermap is preserved.
#
# - The user will be informed by screen messages if the new
#   foomatic-printermap contains new printers which were neither in the
#   previous foomatic-printermap nor under the manually added printers.
#
# - A printer which was added manually before and is in foomatic-printermap
#   now will be removed from the list of manually added printers and added
#   to the list of printers from foomatic-printermap.
