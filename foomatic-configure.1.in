.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foomatic-configure 
is a program to establish and configure print queues, drivers,
spoolers, etc using the foomatic database and companion filters.

It also comprises half of a programatic API for user tools: you can
learn and control everything about the static properties of print
queues here.  With the sister program foomatic-printjob, you can do
everything related to print queue dynamic state: submit jobs, and
query, cancel, reorder, and redirect them.

.SH BUGS
\fBfoomatic-configure\fR currently cannot handle printcap files in the
\fBlprng\fR style.  As \fBlprng\fR can use BSD style printcaps this is
not much of a problem, as long as the GUI based print manager
\fBlprngtool\fR is not used.
The difference between those formats is, that BSD style requires
continuation lines in printer definitions to be ended with a colon and
the newline character to be escaped with a backslash.  \fBLprng\fR has
no such restriction.

To use a printcap file generated or edited with \fBlprngtool\fR with
\fBfoomatic-configure\fR it is necessary to add \fB:\\\fR to the end
of all but the last line of every printer definition, just as shown
below:
.nf
.sp
.ft CW
#comment
# primary printer name
lp
#alternate names
 |lp2|lp3
 |Example of a printer
 :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp
 :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100
 :
