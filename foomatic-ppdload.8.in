.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foomatic-ppdload
takes a ppd filename and a printer ID as arguments.  It
parses a PPD file and writes option data into the foomatic database
for use with the foomatic "ppd" driver and that printer.

With the \fB-R\fR option you can remove a printer from the "ppd"
driver, and with \fB-h\fR a short help text is shown.

Right now, it will handle Boolean and PickOne options that go in the
Prolog, DocumentSetup, or PageSetup spots.  Also, PPD interoption
constraints (not to be confused with foomatic option to printer and
driver mapping constraints) are not supported by foomatic.  And of
course, the interesting color and font information from the PPD has
no place in the current foomatic schema.  All this will change over
time.
