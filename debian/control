Description: FSG OpenPrinting printer support - programs
 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files
 sent to the printer.
 .
 This package contains the architecture-dependent programs needed to
 set up and maintain the foomatic system.  You will also need one or
 more database packages.  The foomatic-db package includes drivers for
 most common printers using Ghostscript as the print processor, as
 well as some common glue code used in other filter systems.
 .
 foomatic-db-hpijs includes support for photo-quality printing with
 Hewlett-Packard and some other consumer inkjets using the HPIJS
 backend developed by HP.
 .
 foomatic-db-gimp-print includes support for photo-quality printing
 with many consumer inkjets (including those from HP and Epson).
 .
 foomatic-gui provides a GNOME-based setup tool for Foomatic printer
 queues using the command-line tools provided in this package.
