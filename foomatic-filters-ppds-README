foomatic-filters-ppds
---------------------

This package contains all PPD files which can be generated from the
Foomatic database, the filter scripts needed to use the PPDs:
"foomatic-rip", "foomatic-gswrapper", and their man pages.

Note: You will need the printer drivers corresponding to the PPDs.

This package is easy to install: simply log in as "root" and run
"./install". Use "./install --prefix /usr" to get the filter scripts
and the man pages into sub-directories of /usr instead of
sub-directories of /usr/local. Use "./install --gzip" to compress the
PPDs (CUPS also understands compressed PPDs).

"./install --help" lists all options of the installer.

Now you can set up print queues as shown on

http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/cups-doc.html
http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/lpd-doc.html
http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/ppr-doc.html
http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/pdq-doc.html
http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/direct-doc.html
http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/ppd-doc.html

But instead of downloading the PPD files from linuxprinting.org you
get them from

/usr/local/share/ppd

or

/usr/share/ppd

on your machine. The scripts "foomatic-rip" and "foomatic-gswrapper"
are already correctly installed on your system.

If you are using CUPS, you can also set up a queue for every printer
supported by linuxprinting.org with the help of the web interface of
CUPS. To do so, you have to restart the CUPS daemon so that your newly
installed PPD files get known to CUPS. Use one of the following
commands, depending on your system:

   killall -HUP cupsd
   /etc/init.d/cups restart
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups restart
   /sbin/init.d/cups restart
   /etc/software/init.d/cups restart

The registration of the PPDs will take several minutes. In this time
you will not get back your prompt and you will not be able to access
your CUPS system.

Then go to http://localhost:631/ with an arbitrary web browser and
setup your printer as usual. In the model selection step you will see
PPD files for every printer/driver combo which is supported by the
Foomatic database.
