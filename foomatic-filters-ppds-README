foomatic-filters-ppds
---------------------

This package contains all PPD files which can be generated from the
Foomatic database, the filter scripts needed to use the PPDs:
"foomatic-rip", "foomatic-gswrapper", and their man pages.

Note: You will need the printer drivers corresponding to the PPDs.

This package is easy to install: simply log in as "root" and run
"./install". Use "./install --prefix /usr" to get the filter scripts
and the man pages into sub-directories of /usr instead of
sub-directories of /usr/local. Use "./install --gzip" to compress the
PPDs (CUPS also understands compressed PPDs).

"./install --help" lists all options of the installer.

Now you can set up print queues as shown on the documentation pages of
the FSG OpenPrinting web site (http://www.openprinting.org/).

But instead of downloading the PPD files from the FSG OpenPrinting web
site you get them from

/usr/local/share/ppd

or

/usr/share/ppd

on your machine. The scripts "foomatic-rip" and "foomatic-gswrapper"
are already correctly installed on your system.

If you are using CUPS, you can also set up a queue for every printer
supported by FSG OpenPrinting with the help of the web interface of
CUPS. To do so and if you are using CUPS 1.1.x or older, you have to
restart the CUPS daemon so that your newly installed PPD files get
known to CUPS. Use one of the following commands, depending on your
system:

   killall -HUP cupsd
   /etc/init.d/cups restart
   sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups restart
   /sbin/init.d/cups restart
   /etc/software/init.d/cups restart

The registration of the PPDs will take several minutes. In this time
you will not get back your prompt and you will not be able to access
your CUPS system.

Then go to http://localhost:631/ with an arbitrary web browser and
setup your printer as usual. In the model selection step you will see
PPD files for every printer/driver combo which is supported by the
Foomatic database.
